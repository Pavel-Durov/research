Source: http://www.cs.williams.edu/~freund/cs434-exemplar/gal-trace.pdf

## Summary

This paper discuss typed loops tracers that are used in dynamic-runtimes such as JavaScript.

The key property of typed loop traces is that they can be compiled to efficient machine code using the same techniques used for typed languages.
